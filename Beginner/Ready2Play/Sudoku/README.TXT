Thank you for downloading and attempting to play my game!                   
	
We need to do a few things before attempting to run the program.            
	
1) Make sure that you have Java Development Kit(JDK) 19 installed on your computer or laptop.     
	Link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows 
	
2) Once JDK is installed, lets extract the program from the ZIP folder      
	while its on your Desktop. (If not, open File Explorer and check:       
	This PC > Downloads and then drag the ZIP folder to your Desktop)       
	
3) Right click on the ZIP folder "Sudoku" and click "Extract All".     
	
4) This will create a folder which we will access in a Command Prompt.      
	To do this, go to your Windows search bar and type "cmd"                
	
5) To access the folder which contains the program, type the following:     
	"cd desktop/sudoku" THEN press ENTER                               
	
6) Now the command prompt is in the folder, let's run the program with:     
	"java sudoku.java"
	
7) Follow instructions in the command prompt. Check below for further
	explanation of how the program runs the game.
	
Please contact me directly with any questions or issues that may arise!

-Refer to the "Sudoku" folder and look for "Figure_1" which will show an 
	example of the board.
	
-When looking at the board, the top left most spot is in Row 1 and Column 1.
	The following spot to the immediate right is Row 1 and Column 2, and so
	on. The spot beneath the top left most spot is Row 2 and Column 1 and so
	on.

-If you complete the board correctly, the game will end and display a message
	saying that you have won! 

-If you don't fill the board correctly, the game will ask if you wish to
	continue. If not, enter any key besides 'Y' and the game will end. If so,
	just press 'Y' and the game will ask you which spot you believe has the
	error and then ask for new value to place.
